    <p>The beetroot is the taproot portion of the beet plant, usually known in North America as the beet, also table beet, garden beet, red beet, or golden beet. It is one of several of the cultivated varieties of Beta vulgaris grown for their edible taproots and their leaves (called beet greens). These varieties have been classified as B. vulgaris subsp. vulgaris Conditiva Group.</p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>Beta is the ancient Latin name for beets, possibly of Celtic origin, becoming bete in Old English around 1400.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>From the Middle Ages, beetroot was used as a treatment for a variety of conditions, especially illnesses relating to digestion and the blood. Bartolomeo Platina recommended taking beetroot with garlic to nullify the effects of "garlic-breath".</p>
